title: Stateless Components
---

The simplest types of React components are those that are stateless: they don't internal have state and don't have any side-effects.

### Defining React Components
To define a component, use the `[<ReactComponent>]` attribute on top of a function that returns `ReactElement`. React components built with have to defined at a *module-level* (i.e. not inside another function).

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import rawGreeting from '/src/components/fsharp/Greeting.fs?raw';
import {Greeting} from '/src/components/fsharp/Greeting.jsx';

<Code code={rawGreeting} lang='fsharp'/>

<Greeting />


### Using React components

Once you have defined a component like we did with `greeting` above, you can use it as a function of type `'props -> ReactElement` and combine with other components like any other UI element:

import rawGreetings from '/src/components/fsharp/Greetings.fs?raw';
import {Greetings} from '/src/components/fsharp/Greetings.jsx';


<Code code={rawGreetings} lang='fsharp'/>
<Greetings />

### Components As Static Functions

React components can also be defined as static members of a static class. The benefit of this approach is that you use _named_ parameters at call-site or implicitly optional parameters in the definition:

import rawGreetingsStatic from '/src/components/fsharp/GreetingsStatic.fs?raw';
import {GreetingsStatic} from '/src/components/fsharp/GreetingsStatic.jsx';


<Code code={rawGreetingsStatic} lang='fsharp'/>
<GreetingsStatic />
