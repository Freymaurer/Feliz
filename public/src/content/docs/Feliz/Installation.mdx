import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To install Feliz into your project, you need to install the nuget package into your F# project

<Tabs syncKey="dep-manager">

<TabItem label="Nuget">
```bash
dotnet add package Feliz
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Paket">
```bash
dotnet add package Feliz
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Femto">
```bash
cd ./project
femto install Feliz
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Then you need to install the corresponding npm dependencies. In case of Feliz, these are `react` and `react-dom`

```bash
npm install react@17.0.1 react-dom@17.0.1
```

### Use Femto

If you happen to use [Femto](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Femto), then it can install everything for you in one go
```bash
cd ./project
femto install Feliz
```
Here, the nuget package will be installed using the package manager that the project is using (detected by Femto) and then the required npm packages will be resolved
